## Data description

* The fictitious online bookstore BuyMyBooks.com has collected data about 
the shopping behaviour of its customers.
* Over the last 3 months, a total of 195.387 customers 
bought books from the store. 
* The collected data is stored in the data sheet and contains the combinations 
of book genres the customer bought.
* E.g. Cell B4 contains the frequency 19 meaning that 19 customers bought 
(at least) one satire book and (at least) one drama book. 
* The diagonal is filled with the number of customers who bought (at least) 
one book in the corresponding genre independent of buying books in other genres.
